        <h2>Interaction Design Individual Project: SmartPark</h2>

        <div class="summary">
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>This is the proejct I worked on for my interaction design course. I designed an integrated parking information system that allows users to keep track of different available parking options at downtown Ann Arbor and at the University of Michigan campus.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="process1">
            <h3>1. First part of my design process focused on problem framing.</h3>
            <p>To frame my problem, I first conducted background research on campus parking and found that parking at university is a real problem that people complain about. Interestingly, my needfinding interviews indicated opposite results that it is not difficult to find parking at the University of Michigan campus and off-campus within acceptable walking distance. However, all of the interviewees complained about the lack of clear parking infomration, including street parking, garage parking and permit parking information. Thus, I changed my design problem from helping people to find parking spot into improving people's experiences finding parking spot. </p>

        <div class="process2">
            <h3>2. Then I explored the solution space by brainstorming and sketching out the solutions.</h3>

        <div class="process3">
            <h3>3. The next process dealt with finding the one good solution.</h3>
            <div class="personas">
                <p>In this process, I develop three personas to represent the needs of three primary users, students, faculties and visitors.</p>

                <img src="images/persona2.jpg" alt="student persona">

            </div>
            
            <div class="qoc">
                <p>Based on their needs, I followed the Questions, Options and Criteria (QOC) approach to narrow down my solution space. The one final solution I chose to develop on is an integrated parking information app because it can provide users the most comprehensive parking information.</p>

        <div class="process4">
            <h3>4. Finally, prototypes! </h3>
            <p>In this final stage of design process, user storymap and user flow were constructed to build the foundation for later low and high fidelity protytyping.</p>
